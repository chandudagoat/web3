### Solana And Me

just following the course by knox

1. Getting balance and airdropping via code

   - need public and private keys for wallet.
   - public key allows us to share with others and recieve / share tokens from other people
   - private key is a secret key that gives access to all the tokens associated with the wallet

   ***

   **IF THE PRIVATE KEY IS LEAKED. ALL THE MONEY FROM THE WALLET CAN BE MANIPULATED HOWEVER THE ACCESSOR WANTS**

   ***

   a connection must be established b/w the wallet and the solana network.
   <br/>
   there are 2 main networks for solana

   - devnet : for development and memeing around
   - mainnet : for production with real tokens and real money involved
